# Example text file description of an atlas (something like the Harvard-Oxford atlas, but only 2 structures for example)
# The conversion tool will ignore blank lines and comments like this
# Each main section is hopefully fairly self explanatory, with the header done differently (key + value per line) from others
# Other sections contain a header line specifying the relevant dictionary keys  (should have standard names, but can be flexibile too)
# The keys in the "STRUCTURES" section here include info that will go into either the "structures" dict or "tags" dict or both
# The "access_key" in "STRUCTURES" can be as specified below (the most general form) or a simpler form: a list of keys like "1,11" 
#   where the order of the keys must correspond to the order to the resources listed under "RESOURCES".  The python conversion tool
#   already caters for this.  For a more complicated situation (5D atlas) see the sample_mods.json file.
# We probably need some more info for example_coord (to transform it between resources) or force it to be a list with one
#   entry per resource - e.g. "23,46,96;23,46,96"   (this is currently not implemented in the conversion tool but would be simple)
